## My process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

A great first project to get started with html and css. I was able to practice grid properties, css custom properties and understand how to use width and max-width properties. I also learned to write a README page and how to host on Netlify. 

### Continued-Development
I would like to keep working on other projects that would involve CSS grid, CSS flexbox and different responsive layouts.

### Useful resources

[HTML and CSS course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ORfgUa8ow&list=PLnHJACx3NwAdT_8forzXYvx0o4A2VnoHX) - by amazing instructor [John Smilga](https://johnsmilga.com/) - This course helped me understand many basics of HTML and CSS.
